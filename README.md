Gradle Migrations Plugin [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/marceloemanoel/gradle-migrations-plugin.png?branch=v0.3)](https://travis-ci.org/marceloemanoel/gradle-migrations-plugin?branch=v0.3)
=============================

Provide gradle build integration with [mybatis migrations](http://mybatis.github.io/migrations). 
The plugin adds a group of tasks named **Migrations** composed by:

<table width="100%">
  <thead>
    <th>
      Task
    </th>
    <th>
      Description
    </th>
    <th>

    <tr>
      <td><a href="#migrateinit">migrateInit</a></td>
      <td>Create migrations repository structure</td>
      <td>-</td>
    </tr>

      <td>v1, v2, out</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="#migrateup-and-migratedown">migrateUp</a></td>
      <td>Apply any pending migration following creation order.</td>
      <td>steps</td>
    </tr>

      <td>Rewinds the database to a previous stage.</td>
      <td>steps</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="#migratepending">migratePending</a></td>
      <td>Apply any pending migrations regardless of their order.</td>
      <td>steps</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Install
=======

Just put the following code snippet in your build.gradle file.

```groovy
buildScript {
  repositories {
    mavenCentral()
  }
  dependencies {
    classpath "com.github.marceloemanoel:gradle-migrations:0.3"
  }
}

apply plugin: "migrations"
```

Configurations
==============

The only **required** configuration is made on your scripts dependencies section.
The plugin add a configuration scope known as `migrationsDriver`. As its name states,
this configuration scope should contain all JDBC drivers that will be used by your migrations.

To use the migrations with a mysql database for example, one should instruct the build as following:

```groovy
dependencies {
  migrationsDriver 'mysql:mysql-connector-java:5+'
}
```

This will ensure that the last mysql connector will be downloaded when you first run any migration task,
it will be cached by gradle and on later calls it will be used from the local repository.

Customization
=============

Following the rule of convention over configuration the plugin adds a configuration closure to your build.
If all default values are good for you, you're ready to go. But if you need to change anything, you'll see that 
it is an easy task. You only need to write the following on your `build.gradle` file: 

```groovy
migrations {
   baseDir = "anotherDirectory"
   environment = "test"
   force = true
}
```

All values are optional. The following table presents the default values of each property:

<table width="100%">
  <thead>
    <th>Property</th>
    <th>Description</th>
    <th>Default Value</th>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>baseDir</td>
      <td>Defines the base directory containing the migrations</td>
      <td>migrations</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>environment</td>
      <td>Defines the database environment used by the tasks</td>
      <td>development</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>force</td>
      <td>Forces the execution of the tasks</td>
      <td>false</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Available Tasks
===============

migrateInit
-----------
The init command initializes a new repository’ of migration scripts. You’ll run init once to create the
workspace in which everything you need to manage database change will be placed. Running this
command will create the directory specified by the `baseDir` property (which is the directory "migrations"
by default). In case it already exists the command will fail unless the property `force` is true. 

When the command is completed, the directory will contain the following sub-directories:

> environments

In the environments folder you will find .properties files that represent your database instances. By
default a `development.properties` file is created for you to configure your development time database
properties. You can also create `test.properties`, `production.properties` or even a `anything.properties` file. 
The environment can be specified when running a migration by using the `environment` property 
without the path or ".properties" part (the default value is "development").

> scripts

This directory contains your migration SQL files. These are the files that contain your DDL to both
upgrade and downgrade your database structure. By default, the directory will contain the script to
create the changelog table, plus one empty example migration script. To create a new migration script,
use the [migrateNew](#migratenew) command. To run all pending migrations in order, use the [migrateUp](#migrateup) 
command. To undo the last migration applied, use the [migrateDown](#migratedown) command etc.

migrateBootstrap
----------------
The bootstrap command enables the starting point for migrations if you’re working from an existing database.
There’s no point in trying to rewind time and shoehorn your existing database into a series of migration scripts. 
It’s more practical to just accept the current state of your database schema and identify this as the starting point.
In the scripts directory you’ll find a file named `bootstrap.sql`. You can put your existing DDL script in this file. 
If you don’t have a DDL script, you can export your existing database schema and put it in the bootstrap file. 
You’ll want to clean it up so that it doesn’t contain anything specific to any one environment, but otherwise almost 
any script should work. Watch out for DDL that contains conditional elements or branching logic that could generate 
multiple schemas. While this is sometimes necessary, it’s a really good idea to try to eliminate this aspect of your
database schema (put such conditional and branching logic in your code or stored procedures instead).
If you have multiple DDL files, you’ll have to merge them into the single bootstrap file. But worry not,
it’s the last time you’ll ever modify it. 

In order to run, the [migrateBootstrap command](#migratebootstrap) need the JDBC driver of your database.
The plugin add the configuration `migrationsDriver` to your project. More information [here](#configurations).

migrateStatus
-------------
The status command will report the current state of the database. 

<pre>
:migrateStatus
ID             Applied At          Description
================================================================================
20130314124532    ...pending...    create changelog
20130314124533    ...pending...    first migration
</pre>

migrateNew
----------
This task enable the creation of new migrations. Every migration script file should have a .sql extension 
and have both sections **DO** and **UNDO**. As soon you init the migrations repository two files are 
created for you, the changelog migration and the first migration. The changelog migration contains 
the following code:

```sql
--// Create Changelog

-- Default DDL for changelog table that will keep
-- a record of the migrations that have been run.

-- You can modify this to suit your database before
-- running your first migration.

-- Be sure that ID and DESCRIPTION fields exist in
-- BigInteger and String compatible fields respectively.

CREATE TABLE ${changelog} (
ID NUMERIC(20,0) NOT NULL,
APPLIED_AT VARCHAR(25) NOT NULL,
DESCRIPTION VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

ALTER TABLE ${changelog}
ADD CONSTRAINT PK_${changelog}
PRIMARY KEY (id);

--//@UNDO

DROP TABLE ${changelog};
```

This file is composed of three sections:

* Description: Delimited by `--//`, used to describe the migration in the database.

```sql
--// Create Changelog
```

* DO: Everything after the description, used to push forward the database

```sql

-- Default DDL for changelog table that will keep
-- a record of the migrations that have been run.

-- You can modify this to suit your database before
-- running your first migration.

-- Be sure that ID and DESCRIPTION fields exist in
-- BigInteger and String compatible fields respectively.

CREATE TABLE ${changelog} (
ID NUMERIC(20,0) NOT NULL,
APPLIED_AT VARCHAR(25) NOT NULL,
DESCRIPTION VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

ALTER TABLE ${changelog}
ADD CONSTRAINT PK_${changelog}
PRIMARY KEY (id);

```

* UNDO: Everything after the `--//@UNDO` line, used to push backward the database

```sql

DROP TABLE ${changelog};
```

The migrateNew task needs **one** parameter to work as expected, the description of what this migration 
will do to your database. It is used like this:

> gradle migrateNew -Pdescription="This is a sample migration"

This parameter can be abreviated as simple as this:

> gradle migrateNew -Pd="This is a sample migration"

migrateScript
-------------

This task enables the creation of a schema file that reflects the needed changes from one version into another.
This makes possible the communication with other professionals like DBAs or a team of them. Since you can't change
the database hand over the file to them so they can execute it.

The migrateScript can generate evolutionary changes as well as involutionary changes like [migrateDown](#migrateup-and-migratedown).
The final behavior will depend on the two versions given. For instance, given the following migrations:

<pre>
ID             Applied At          Description
==================================================================
20090802210445 2009-08-04 22:51:17 create changelog
20090804225207 2009-08-04 22:51:17 create author table
20090804225328 2009-08-05 24:55:23 create blog table
20090804225333 2009-08-04 22:51:17 create post table
</pre>

If executed like this:
> gradle migrateScript -Pv1=20090802210445 -Pv2=20090804225333

The task will print to the console all the sql code to move from version v1 evolving the database to version v2.
In the other hand, if executed like this:
> gradle migrateScript -Pv1=20090804225333 -Pv2=20090802210445

The task will print to the console all the sql code needed to move from version v1 devolving the database into version v2.      
This task also accepts another parameter. The `out` parameter enables the redirection of the output to a given file.
Using the last command to redirect to a file called `migration.sql` it should be like this:
> gradle migrateScript -Pv1=20090804225333 -Pv2=20090802210445 -Pout=migration.sql  
  
migrateUp and migrateDown
-------------------------

Theses tasks enable the evolving and devolving of your database. They use the script files inside the scripts directory.

The task `migrateUp` uses the **DO section** of the migration scripts to push forward your database and 
the `migrateDown`, in its turn, uses its **UNDO section** to push backward your database.

Both tasks have a parameter named `steps`. By default its value is **1** for `migrateDown` since you probably want to 
rollback only the last migration. For `migrateUp` the default value is `Integer.MAX_VALUE` this is because you probanly
want to execute all upwards pending migrations. The parameter is easily applied through the command line as following:

> gradle migrateUp -Psteps=2

or

> gradle migrateDown -Psteps=3

It is possible to abreviate it like this:

> gradle migrateUp -Ps=2

or 

> gradle migrateDown -Ps=3

migratePending
--------------

At development time on a team with more than one developer it is likely that many migration script are created. If anytime
occurs a situation where someone create a migration before you but commit it to the source control later than you. You'll
have a situation like this: 

<pre>
ID             Applied At          Description
==================================================================
20090802210445 2009-08-04 22:51:17 create changelog
20090804225207 2009-08-04 22:51:17 create author table
20090804225328    ...pending...    create blog table
20090804225333 2009-08-04 22:51:17 create post table
</pre>

The expected behaviour should be to rollback your changes until the previous pending version and then use migrateUp to apply
all of your pending migrations in order. But, if you think that the changes are not conflicting, then go ahead and apply them
out of order with the migratePending command. The expected result should be something like this:

<pre>
ID             Applied At          Description
==================================================================
20090802210445 2009-08-04 22:51:17 create changelog
20090804225207 2009-08-04 22:51:17 create author table
20090804225328 2009-08-05 24:55:23 create blog table
20090804225333 2009-08-04 22:51:17 create post table
</pre>

This should be used while in development phase. Since in production you must already have a pack of migrations ready do to the trick.
